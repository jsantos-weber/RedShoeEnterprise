/* This is a pretty standard employee and asset tracking database */

/* 
Rules of engagement...

 - All objects that you create need to have a prefix in front of them.  It
	should be the same prefix for all objects.  Pick whatever you want - 
	an example..  SuperGroup_AddEmployee or PatriotsRule_NewComputer

 - You can change the table design if you want but you have to provide
	alter table scripts as part of your submission.  

 - Look at the tables and take obvious steps to prevent bad data from getting
	into them as you build stored procedures, triggers, functions, etc.  For
	example - can two people have the same computer at the same time?

 - Always fail gracefully.  Trap errors and return messages

 - There is a lot of work to be done.  Don't wait until the last minute
	or you will not get it done


All the things you have to get done...

 - Stored procedures that accomplish the following things:

	- Create new departments (DONE)
	- Update the name of existing departments (DONE)
	- Create new employees.  Every new employee has to have a job.  Job
		information is stored in "EmployeeJobs".  Make sure you trap
		errors and prevent orphan records in the Employees table. (DONE)
	- Update an employees job.  Any update to a job should generate
		a new record for that employee in the EmployeeJobs table.  This
		would include changing their title, salary, or supervisor.  This
		can be one or many stored procedures (DONE NEEDS TESTING)
	- Update an employees department (DONE)
	- Terminate an employee.  When an employee is terminated, their
		computer equipment is returned to the company.  Their job
		record is also ended. (DONE NEEDS TESTING)
	- Add a new computer to the companies inventory.  The details of the computer
		should be stored in the ComputerDetails field in JSON.  The details
		should include, at a minimum, the brand, serial number, CPU,
		amount of memory, one or more storage devices with their type and
		storage capacity.  Make sure no	bad JSON makes it into your table.
	- Assign/return/report lost/retire a computer.  You cannot retire
		a computer that still has some value left (has to be put back 
		in inventory or reported as lost).

		was left when it was lost. 



Once you have everything done, complete the following:
 
 - Add 5 new employees, one at each level
 - Add 5 new computers and assign them to your new employees
 - Change the salary of 3 people at the grunt level
 - Create a new department.  Assign one of your employees to it
 - Change someone to a new supervisor and give them a new title
 - Terminate two employees.  Run your view of active computers to make
	sure their computers show up as available afterwards.
 - Have a computer be lost.
 - Try to delete all your managers.  Make sure your trigger fires
 - Select all records from your two views.  See if you can find any errors
	that occured with the above work.

Include your lengthly script as part of your submission
